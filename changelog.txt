v1.0
+dataset from file
+file parameter
-x,y
+test with dataset
-hardcoded xor set
-delta's calculation when testing

v1.1
+input changed to doubles
-couts of parameters
+allowed maxepochs and convergence as optional parameters, added optional testset
-forward iteration before training starts

v1.2
+calculate average total delta over output nodes
+put everything in class neuralnet
+changed non-negative ints to size_t's

v1.3
-debugging couts
+measure training time
+saving/loading, using menu
+random init in seperate function

v1.4
+verbose option for training
+verbose option for whole program
+get inputs and outputs from datasets
+training using convergence, not just maxepochs (expanded the while condition at the top of neuralnet::train)
+noinput option
+removed verbose option for saving/loading (it makes more sense to do this in main)

v1.5
+batch mode
+verbose option for training
+changed how main couts, so that nonverbose just returns three numbers under each other
+output standardised for use in GNUplot

v1.6
+Fixed bug: c_rate not initialised, so it wouldn't work outside batch mode
+Added batch and bigbatch options in makefile, to gather some data

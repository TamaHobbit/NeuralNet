# NeuralNet

A small neural network implementation written during my bachelor of CS.

# Usage

```
make
make batch
make plot.png
```

That runs the neural network for a test dataset, the iris database, and generates plots of the learning rate, epochs and number of hidden nodes. You will need to run `make bigbatch` first, in order to get a meaningful plot.
